# Group_vel_alaska

Group Velocity data for T = 8~24 s

Grid spacing (1 deg in longitude, 0.5 deg in latitude)

For example, there is a file 203.0_65.0_U.txt, for (lon, lat) = (203., 65.). The file looks as follows:

Period(sec) U(km/s) Error_U(km/s)

8 2.7528 0.0286996

10 2.8119 0.0245098

12 2.8434 0.0242083

14 2.8445 0.022104

16 2.8623 0.0233761

18 2.906 0.0229917

20 2.9789 0.0228966

22 3.0681 0.0247643

24 3.1678 0.0276102

The first column is period, second one is group velocity and the third one is the corresponding uncertainty.
